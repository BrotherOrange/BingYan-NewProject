Today I still have no idea about the game just like Zork1.
These two days I have first learnt about the Git, Github and the game, Zork.
So I begin to write my diary on Github today.
Today I download some code that written by others to study.
It's TOO HARD FOR ME!!!
However, I will try my best to do this job. I believe I can learn a lot in these days.
In spite of the failure that doom to be, I must try!
