Today I learn something about C language.
In a way, it can be a lot of things.
And I have some ideas about the game.
I want give it a name.
The name is "The Lost City".
It is a game about running away from an old city.
The player is the No.1 actor in this game.
And some npc will help you and give you some information at the right time.
And every command you input, you can get a request.
You should let these sentences to guide youself.
However, All of these are all still in a frame.
The time has passed a half.
I realize that what I have learnt is still too little to support me to finish the game.
But I will still try.
